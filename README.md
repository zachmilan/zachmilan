# Hi, my name is Zach.

## About Me
I’m a recent **Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Michigan (May 2025)** with experience in embedded systems, PCB design, and hardware/software integration, with an interest in developing consumer-focused embedded devices. 

I’m seeking a **full-time role in embedded systems or adjacent fields** where I can continue designing and building real-world hardware/software products.
