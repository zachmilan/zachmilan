# 👋 Hi, I’m Zachary Milan

## 💻 About Me
I’m a recent **Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Michigan**  
with a focus on **embedded systems, PCB design, and hardware/software integration.**  

I enjoy taking projects from concept → schematic → PCB layout → firmware bring-up,  
and I’m currently working on **UM-LED**, a dual-PCB Bluetooth-controlled LED display system.

## 🔧 Technical Skills
- **Embedded Systems**: STM32, ESP32, FreeRTOS, low-power design
- **Programming**: C, C++, Python, Arduino/embedded C frameworks
- **Hardware Design**: KiCad, PCB layout, schematic capture, power regulation
- **Communication Protocols**: I²C, SPI, UART, BLE, USB
- **Tools**: Git/GitHub, STM32CubeIDE, Arduino IDE, JTAG/SWD debugging
