## Hi, my name is Zach Milan.

I'm a recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Michigan (May 2025) with a focus in embedded systems and computer architecture. 

I have experience in hardware-software integration from coursework and personal projects (including PCB design and assembly) as well as strong communcation skills developed over the years working in a variety of roles. 

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in firmware or hardware engineering as well as customer-facing roles such as Field Application Engineering (FAE) or Technical Sales Engineering. However, I am open to working outside the realm of those titles as I believe many jobs are sufficiently interesting and provide an environment to learn something new. 

I enjoy working with people, asking questions, and understanding the 'why' behind things. I believe I can be an asset to any team that hires me. If you would like to reach out about a potential opportunity, please email me at zmilan@umich.edu.

## Featured Projects 

| **UM-LED — BLE Controlled LED Display** | |
|---|---|
| Developing a remote-controlled LED display system with touch brightness adjustment, haptic feedback, auto-dimming, USB-C rechargeability, and more. <br><br> The remote has been designed, assembled, and brought up successfully. Drivers for the accelerometer and haptic controller are complete. Currently writing firmware for the remote. <br><br>[Project Repo](https://github.com/zachmilan/UM-LED) \| [Overview/Specification](https://github.com/zachmilan/UM-LED/blob/main/docs/UM-LED_InitialDesignProposal.pdf) | <img src="https://github.com/zachmilan/UM-LED/blob/main/images/IMG_8023.jpg?raw=true" alt="UM-LED" width="350" /> |
