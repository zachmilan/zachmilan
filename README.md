<h1> Zachary Milan </h1>

<code> I am a recent computer engineering graduate from the University of Michigan with an interest in embedded systems and hardware/sotware integration, specifically consumer products. I like to think about the end-user experience, and design for the end-user throughout the build process. I am currently working on a personal project (UM_LED), a remote-controlled LED display for my desk in the shape of Michigan's "Block M". The project will include features such as capacative touch brightness control, haptic feedback, auto-dim, and power logging to an SD card. I am currently seeking a full-time role in a related field. 

Please feel free to reach out to me at zmilan@umich.edu
