# Hi, my name is Zach.

## About Me
I’m a recent **Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Michigan (May 2025)** with experience in embedded systems, PCB design, and hardware/software integration, with an interest in developing consumer-focused embedded devices. 

I’m seeking a **full-time role in embedded systems or adjacent fields** where I can continue designing and building real-world hardware/software products.

## Featured Projects 

| **UM-LED — BLE Controlled LED Display** | |
|---|---|
| Developing a remote-controlled LED display with capacitive-touch brightness adjustment, haptic feedback, auto-dimming, USB-C rechargeability, and more. <br><br> The remote has been designed, assembled, and brought up successfully. Drivers for the accelerometer and haptic controller are complete. Currently finalizing the remote firmware and its control flow. <br><br>[Project Repo](https://github.com/zachmilan/UM-LED) \| [Overview/Specification](https://github.com/zachmilan/UM-LED/blob/main/docs/UM-LED_InitialDesignProposal.pdf) | <img src="https://github.com/zachmilan/UM-LED/blob/main/images/IMG_8023.jpg?raw=true" alt="UM-LED" width="350" /> |
